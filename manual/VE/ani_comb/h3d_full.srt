00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,000
Introduction of objects of interest,
starting outside sampled region.

00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,000
Connected arteries (red) and veins (blue) with capillaries up to a proximity of about 30 µm together with adjacent terminal bronchioles (<i>Bt</i>, grey) and beginning of its acinus.

00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,000
Largest part of an acinus (<i>Acn</i>, light grey) contained within sampled region.

00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,000
Capillary network (<i>ACN-Acn</i> magenta) in proximity of <i>Acn</i> up to about 10 µm.

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,000
View along an alveolar duct that extends beyond the z-depth of the sampled region.

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,000
Note: no tissue is rendered. This leads to the gaps between e.g. <i>Bt</i> and <i>Acn</i>.

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,000
Beginning to follow a possible path of an <b>O2</b> molecule.

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,000
Camera now enters sampled region.
Right side of Bt is just about contained in the sampled region.

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,000
Multiple airway bifurcations appear nearly at the same position.

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,000
Bumps in the surface of <i>Bt</i> are no artefacts,
but apparent terraces are.

00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,000
About to enter a connected acinus (not <i>Acn</i>),
which mostly lies outside the sampled region.

00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,000
# Reaching the bronchoalveolar duct junction (BADJ), where a minimal constriction of the airway exists.

00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,000
# or the surface covering the rim of the tubular ending of non-parenchymal tissue about x µm further on.

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,000
Artefacts originating from fragmented tissue are present in this region of the dataset.

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,000
The first alveoli are about reached. These are significantly smaller than the average.

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,000
Camera now exits sampled region.

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,000
Start of the transition from <i>Bt</i> to <i>Acn</i>, used to outline further details from an over view.

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,000
An unobscured view of the ACN contained within the septa is given at the opened surfaces at the borders of the dataset.

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,000
As the vessel system is incomplete, the ACN is coloured magenta except in the proximity of the arteries and veins.

00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,000
There a distance gradient is coloured from red to blue.

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,000
Vessel connection outside the dataset can lead to false colouring at the borders of the dataset.

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,000
Visible alveoli now have their standard size.
The increased transparency of <i>Bt</i> reveals the underlying capillaries.

00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,000
The vessel segments are smoothed less in order to preserve their finer details in comparison to the air segment.

00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,000
Parts of <i>Acn</i> (light grey) are now in view.

00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,000
As the ACN is only rendered in near proximity, visual distinction between inner and outer side of <i>Acn, Bt</i> is easy.

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,000
Some regions of the ACN do not suffer from missing connections, see marks.

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,000
Most missing connection in the ACN originate from remaining erythrocytes and not from reconstruction artefacts.

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,000
Beginning to close up on the largest duct entry of <i>Acn</i>.

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,000
Many ducts branching off can be observed, a particular ordering is not obvious.

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,000
Small, outward bumps on the alveolar surface likely originate from macrophages.

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,000
Camera now enters sampled region again.

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,000
An arteriole (red) embedded in septa comes into view.

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,000
Further inside the dataset, the ACN is more complete.

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,000
Removing transparency to allow focusing on the arrangement of alveoli.
A particular ordering is not obvious.

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,000
Viewing along the open duct towards the camera position when it was first pointed out.

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,000
Closing up on an alveolar cluster referred to as <i>A45</i>.

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,000
The ACN surrounding <i>A45</i> (<i>ACN-A45</i>) was manually refined to also include erythrocytes (red segments).

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,000
The white line within the ACN indicates the path we are going to follow.

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,000
Transitioning from the air lumen through the gas diffusion area into the blood lumen.

00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,000
A cylinder with a length of 5 µm to indicate the scale.

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,000
About to pass through the tightest constriction (about 1 to 2 µm) along the whole path taken.
